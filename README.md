# AO.com Tech Challenge 

My own interpretation of the AO.com challenge: create an image-based SPA that allows you to like / unlike photos from Flickr.

## Quick start (browse a hosted version from Heroku)

## Thoughts & designs 

I chose the Instagram style layout because it matched the styles of the deals page at the time (Black Friday). 

Like the deals page, the SPA layout starts out as a grid of 3 cards per row, shrinking to two on tablets and one on mobile.

### Drawing out the components 

![drawing of the components](./drawing-of-components.png)

The end result had a few refactors and I've ended up with 5 presentational components and one container component

### The Data 

Data is coming from a signed Flickr API call loaded into the app through environment variables: 

https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?method=flickr.photos.search&api_key=XXXXXXXXXX&user_id=&tags=animals&text=goats&sort=relevance&safe_search=&content_type=1&place_id=&media=&extras=url_m%2C+views&format=json&nojsoncallback=1

The method used was flickr.photo.search, because it returned the most relevant results paired with:
- tags: animals, goats
- sort: relevance
- content_type: 1 (just photos)
- extras: url_m (medium sized image link), views 

### The Application Data

App data is handled by Redux with a very simple set of actions and reducers. Most of the unit testing had been done on the Redux, after all the data dictates changes to the UI. 

The redux store mainly contains the photosData object which branches into photos and favourites. An action populated main photosData. 

The app allow a visitor to quickly favourite a photo, which triggers another set of actions that either remove the photo from state and adds it to favourites or vice versa. 

### Routing

Routing is done using React Router v4 and it covers two routes: '/' and '/favourites'.

Routing caused some problems because the app required a container component to render parent which in turn would render a list with two different props. Routing v4 always seems to be awkward because there's a shortage of well written guides out there and the big changes in architecture.

### Persistent storage

I was debating between a library and a custom solution and choose to write the function myself. You can find it in localStorage.js and the function makes use of the localStorage api. 

This tackles the challenge of persisting favourites after page refresh.

```
export const loadState = () => {
    try {
        const serializedState = localStorage.getItem('state');
        if (serializedState === null) {
            return undefined;
        }
        return JSON.parse(serializedState);
    } catch (err) {
        return undefined;
    }

};

export const saveState = (state) => {
    try {
        const serializedState = JSON.stringify(state);
        localStorage.setItem('state', serializedState);
    } catch (err) {
        // Ignore write errors
    }
};
```
### CSS and styling

For speed considerations I decided to use bulma for styling, a css framework that uses Flexbox. What I gained in speed I lost in bloat, so to get rid of redudant code I used Sass to only load the components I needed and edit the framework default variables. 

Made use of Font Awesome for icons and Sass again to custom load the components. 

### Code quality 

I'm a big fan of the Airbnb Javascript style guide so I used their linting packages alongside Prettier, a code formater. The linting plugin also include a11y accesibility rules. Further accesibility considerations went into the dynamic Title tag swapping between the two routes of the app. 

Husky was use to run tests and linting before every test.

## Slow start (dowload the app)

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

#### node.js

node.js must be installed on your machine (any versions will work; v7.10.0 was used for this project)

```
$ node -v // v7.10.0
```

To install node follow this guide -  https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#osx

#### npm

npm is required (any versions will work; v4.2.0 was used for this project)

```
$ npm -v // 4.2.0
```

To install npm follow this guide - https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node

#### Install

Clone the repo and install the app using this command

```
npm i
```

### Start the app

The app was built using the create-react-app scripts for easier deployment to Heroku

To start the app run the start script

```
$ npm start
```

## Running the tests

The tests are built using Jest and moxios for mocking requests.

To run the tests, type the following command in your terminal anywhere withing the project folder

```
$ npm t
```

The tests available: 
- actions.test
- photos.reducer.test

### Actions Testing patterns

removeFromFavourites() SYNC action

```javascript
describe('removeFromFavourites', () => {
    const input = {
      id: '1',
      title: 'Stretching for food',
      link: 'https://www.flickr.com/photos/vassilisonline/38593667296/'
    };
    expect(actions.removeFromFavourites(input)).toEqual({
      type: 'REMOVE FROM FAVOURITES',
      payload: input
    });
  });

```

fetchPhotos() ASYNC action

```javascript
describe('fetchPhotos ASYNC', () => {
    beforeEach(() => {
      moxios.install();
    });

    afterEach(() => {
      moxios.uninstall;
    });
    test('returns correct series of actions and payload if succesful', () => {
      moxios.wait(() => {
        const request = moxios.requests.mostRecent();
        request.respondWith({
          status: 200,
          response: {
            items: [
              {
                title: 'Stretching for food',
                link:
                  'https://www.flickr.com/photos/vassilisonline/38593667296/'
              }
            ]
          }
        });
      });

      const store = mockStore({
        items: [
          {
            title: 'Stretching for food',
            link: 'https://www.flickr.com/photos/vassilisonline/38593667296/'
          }
        ]
      });

      const expectedActions = [
        { type: types.FETCH_PHOTOS_REQUEST },
        {
          type: types.FETCH_PHOTOS_SUCCESS,
          payload: {
            items: [
              {
                title: 'Stretching for food',
                link:
                  'https://www.flickr.com/photos/vassilisonline/38593667296/'
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ];
      return store.dispatch(actions.fetchPhotos()).then(() => {
        expect(store.getActions()).toEqual(expectedActions);
      });
    });
  });
```

### Reducers Testing patterns

fetchPhotos() photos.reducer.js

```javascript
 describe('fetchPhotos', () => {
    test('adds a collection of photos to the new state', () => {
      const action = actions.fetchPhotosSuccess({
        photos: {
          photo: [{ '2': 2 }, { '1': 1 }]
        }
      });
      const newState = reducer(initialState, action);
      expect(Array.isArray(newState.data)).toBe(true);
      expect(newState.data).toEqual([{ '2': 2 }, { '1': 1 }]);
    });
```
